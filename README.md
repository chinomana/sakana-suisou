# Fugu Vibe CLI

**English** | [中文](README.zh.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

A Python CLI for using Sakana Fugu-style APIs from a terminal. It provides an interactive prompt, optional orchestration visualization, project workspace selection, async task submission, and Fugu-specific request handling.

## Current Status

This project is early-stage. The stable path is the normal text-based `vibe` session.

- Text input: usable.
- PDF/image/file attachments: usable in `vibe` via `--file` or `/attach`.
- Workspace selection: usable via `-C/--workspace`.
- Session output: saved under `.fugu-vibe/sessions/` in the selected workspace.
- Async task status/output: saved under `.fugu-vibe/tasks/` in the selected workspace.
- Runtime workspace artifacts under `.fugu-vibe/` and `.fugu-worktrees/` are ignored by git.
- Orchestration dashboard: optional via `--viz` or `fugu-vibe dashboard`; shows live token usage, orchestration ratio, and budget alerts.
- Headless mode: usable via `fugu-vibe run` for CI/SDK-style one-shot execution.
- MCP integration: experimental stdio MCP servers can be registered and exposed through `mcp_list_tools` / `mcp_call`.
- Voice mode: placeholder only. The recorder/STT scaffolding exists, but push-to-talk/background voice interaction is not fully implemented yet.

This CLI sends prompts and file context to Fugu and records the output. It does not yet automatically apply model-generated patches to your source tree.

## Install

Use Python 3.11-3.13. Python 3.14 may hit dependency/runtime issues on macOS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fugu-vibe/fugu-vibe-cli.git
cd fugu-vibe-cli

# Recommended
uv venv .venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

# Or with pip inside your own virtualenv
pip install -e .
```

## Authentication

```bash
export SAKANA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Or save it through the CLI:

```bash
fugu-vibe auth login
fugu-vibe auth status
```

If you use a proxy or unofficial compatible endpoint:

```bash
export FUGU_VIBE_API_BASE_URL="https://your-proxy.example/v1"
```

or pass it per command:

```bash
fugu-vibe --base-url https://your-proxy.example/v1 vibe
```

## Interactive Use

Start a stable text session:

```bash
fugu-vibe vibe
```

Inside the session:

- Type a prompt and press Enter.
- Use `/context` to inspect current prompt context.
- Use `/compact` to compact older conversation turns into a local summary.
- Use `/ls [glob]`, `/read <path>`, and `/search <query> [glob]` to inspect workspace files safely.
- Use `/diff` to inspect current git diff.
- Use `/apply <patch-file>` to check and apply a unified diff under the configured patch policy.
- Use `/tools` to inspect local tool policy.
- Use `/terminal <command>` to run a workspace terminal command only when terminal tools are explicitly enabled.
- Use `/attach <path>` to add PDF/image/file context.
- Use `/files` and `/clear-files` to inspect or clear attached files.
- Use `/status` to show task status.
- Use `/tasks` to list active tasks.
- Use `/help` to show session commands.
- Use `/quit`, `/q`, `/exit`, `Ctrl+C`, or `Ctrl+D` to exit.

Useful options:

```bash
fugu-vibe vibe --model fugu-ultra --effort xhigh
fugu-vibe vibe --web-search
fugu-vibe vibe --file spec.pdf --file screenshot.png
fugu-vibe vibe --unlimited
```

Attach files during a session:

```text
/attach spec.pdf
/attach screenshot.png notes.txt
/files
/clear-files
```

Attachments are sent with each prompt until you clear them. Images are sent as image inputs; PDFs and other files are sent as file inputs.
Small text/code files are inlined as text context. Attachments larger than 25 MB are rejected before sending.

Session transcripts are written to:

```text
.fugu-vibe/sessions/<timestamp>.md
```

Current context metadata is written to:

```text
.fugu-vibe/context/current.json
```

Workspace file inspection commands are read-only and constrained to the selected workspace. They skip runtime/cache directories such as `.git/`, `.fugu-vibe/`, `.venv/`, and `node_modules/`.

The interactive session can execute Fugu function calls for workspace file, terminal, git, and MCP bridge tools when those tool groups are enabled by policy.

Terminal execution is disabled by default. To enable manual terminal runs in `vibe`, set:

```toml
[tools]
terminal_enabled = true
terminal_approval = "ask"
```

Then use:

```text
/tools
/terminal git status
```

The terminal tool is constrained to the workspace, blocks common destructive command patterns, applies a timeout, truncates displayed output, and saves full logs under `.fugu-vibe/tool-runs/`. Safe validation commands such as `run_test` can run automatically after successful edits when `[tools] auto_test_after_edit = true`.

Patch application defaults to `ask-apply`. `/apply <patch-file>` validates patch paths, runs `git apply --check`, shows the diff, and asks for `yes` before applying. Set `[patch] mode = "propose-only"` to disable applying patches from the CLI.

Enable the dashboard only when you want it:

```bash
fugu-vibe vibe --viz
```

You can also keep `vibe` in one terminal and open the dashboard in another terminal for the same workspace:

```bash
# Terminal 1: work normally
fugu-vibe -C /path/to/project vibe

# Terminal 2: watch the dashboard for that workspace
fugu-vibe -C /path/to/project dashboard
```

The two-terminal dashboard reads `.fugu-vibe/events.jsonl` in the selected workspace. It only shows events produced after `vibe` starts.


## Headless Runs and MCP

Run one prompt without entering the interactive prompt:

```bash
fugu-vibe run "Summarize this repository"
fugu-vibe run --script task.md --json
```

`--json` returns a structured result with `ok`, `content`, `tool_calls`, `rounds`, and selected `effort`, which is useful for CI or SDK-style integrations.

Register stdio MCP servers per workspace:

```bash
fugu-vibe mcp add filesystem python path/to/server.py
fugu-vibe mcp list
fugu-vibe mcp tools filesystem
```

When MCP is enabled, Fugu can discover server tools through `mcp_list_tools` and call them through `mcp_call`. MCP configuration is stored under `.fugu-vibe/mcp.json` and is ignored by git.

```toml
[mcp]
enabled = true
timeout_seconds = 30
```

## Working In A Specific Workspace

Use `-C/--workspace` before the subcommand:

```bash
fugu-vibe -C /path/to/project vibe
```

This changes the process working directory before loading project config and before initializing git/worktree handling. It affects commands such as `vibe`, `submit`, and `config`.

You can also set it with an environment variable:

```bash
export FUGU_VIBE_WORKSPACE="/path/to/project"
fugu-vibe vibe
```

## Async Tasks

Submit a task:

```bash
fugu-vibe submit "Refactor auth" -p "Refactor the authentication module"
```

Include files as context:

```bash
fugu-vibe submit "Review spec" -p "Summarize this spec" -f spec.pdf --wait
```

Wait for completion:

```bash
fugu-vibe submit "Analyze code" -p "Review the codebase" --wait
```

Use dependencies:

```bash
fugu-vibe submit "Write tests" -p "Add tests" --depends-on <task-id>
```

Check status:

```bash
fugu-vibe status
fugu-vibe status <task-id>
fugu-vibe status --watch
```

Attach or cancel:

```bash
fugu-vibe attach <task-id>
fugu-vibe cancel <task-id>
```

Task records are stored in `.fugu-vibe/tasks/`. Tasks record Fugu output and metadata, but do not automatically apply code changes to the workspace yet.

`submit` currently keeps the submitting process alive while queued/running tasks execute. Use `--wait` when you want the command to print the final result in the same terminal.

## Configuration

Config is loaded in this order, from highest to lowest priority:

1. CLI flags
2. Environment variables
3. Project config: `.fugu-vibe.toml`
4. User config: `~/.config/fugu-vibe/config.toml`
5. Defaults

Create or inspect config:

```bash
fugu-vibe config init
fugu-vibe config init --global
fugu-vibe config show
fugu-vibe config path
fugu-vibe config set model.default fugu-ultra
```

Example `.fugu-vibe.toml`:

```toml
[api]
base_url = "https://api.sakana.ai/v1"
timeout = 7200
stream_idle_timeout_ms = 7200000

[model]
default = "fugu-ultra"
reasoning_effort = "xhigh"
max_output_tokens = 32768

[tasks]
max_parallel = 5
use_git_worktree = true
auto_merge = true

[prompt]
unlimited_mode = false

[tools]
max_tool_rounds = 10
auto_test_after_edit = true
auto_test_command = "python -m pytest -q"
```

Do not commit API keys or local config containing secrets.

## Voice Mode

Voice mode is currently a placeholder. The code contains recorder/STT scaffolding, but full push-to-talk and continuous voice interaction are not production-ready.

These commands may exist, but should not be treated as stable:

```bash
fugu-vibe vibe --voice
fugu-vibe voice --continuous
```

## Development

Default CLI output is kept quiet. Use `--verbose` before the subcommand to show debug logs:

```bash
fugu-vibe --verbose vibe
```

Local terminal tools are disabled by default. Patch application policy defaults to `ask-apply`; future patch tooling should show a diff and ask before modifying files.

```bash
uv venv .venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

pytest
ruff check .
mypy fugu_vibe/
```
